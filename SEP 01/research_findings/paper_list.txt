1. Trajectory Modeling
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00732 
    - use RMSE/ MAE/ MAPE to evaluate volume of traffic/people flow/ETA/TTE(Estimated time arrival/ Travel time estimation)
    - next place/ abnormal detection: Accuracy?F1/Precision
        - baseline different, and hard to replicated.
    - H3 + transformer(TrajBERT„ÄÅSan Francisco GPS): encode GPS point into token than prediction
    - GEO-Conv(dealing with arrival time):use road network information to establish graph, and learn the relation between time and sapce
    - give example how different task and data
    - conclusion
        - task with ETA/ volume of traffic use RMSE/MAE/MAPE, classification task use Accuracy/ F1, many task need open-source baseline and codebase
